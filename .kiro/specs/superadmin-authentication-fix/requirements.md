# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue of ensuring proper superadmin authentication and authorization for ojidelawrence@gmail.com in the Gospel Labour Ministry church management system. The system currently has authentication issues preventing the designated superadmin from accessing administrative functions, which blocks critical system management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designated superadmin (ojidelawrence@gmail.com), I want to be able to log in with my credentials and immediately have full administrative access, so that I can manage the church management system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the superadmin enters email "ojidelawrence@gmail.com" and password "Fa-#8rC6DRTkd$5" THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully
2. WHEN the superadmin logs in THEN the system SHALL grant immediate access to all administrative functions
3. WHEN the superadmin accesses any admin feature THEN the system SHALL not display permission denied errors
4. WHEN the authentication process completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate admin dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the superadmin account to be properly configured in the database with all necessary roles and permissions, so that authentication and authorization work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking the auth.users table THEN the system SHALL contain a confirmed account for ojidelawrence@gmail.com
2. WHEN checking the members table THEN the system SHALL contain a corresponding member record with appropriate category
3. WHEN checking the user_roles table THEN the system SHALL contain a 'superuser' role assignment for the account
4. WHEN the account is created or updated THEN the system SHALL ensure email confirmation status is set to confirmed
5. IF the password needs to be reset THEN the system SHALL update the encrypted password correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database Row Level Security (RLS) policies to properly recognize and allow superadmin access, so that the superadmin can perform all necessary operations without being blocked by security restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are evaluated for the superadmin THEN the system SHALL grant full access to all tables
2. WHEN the superadmin performs any database operation THEN the system SHALL not be blocked by RLS policies
3. WHEN RLS policies check user roles THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the superuser role
4. IF RLS policies are causing access issues THEN the system SHALL provide emergency access mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the superadmin authentication fix is working correctly, so that I can confirm the issue is resolved and the system is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running verification queries THEN the system SHALL return correct superadmin account details
2. WHEN testing login functionality THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully without errors
3. WHEN accessing admin features THEN the system SHALL display all administrative options
4. WHEN checking system logs THEN the system SHALL show successful authentication events
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle authentication gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication fix to be implemented safely without affecting other users or system functionality, so that the system remains stable and secure for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN the system SHALL not affect other user accounts
2. WHEN updating database records THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
3. WHEN modifying authentication settings THEN the system SHALL preserve existing security measures
4. WHEN the fix is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality for regular users
5. IF any issues occur during implementation THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
