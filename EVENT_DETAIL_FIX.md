# Event Detail Page Fix

## Problem Fixed
The "View Event Details" button in EventCard was linking to `/events/:id` but there was no corresponding page or route to handle individual event details, resulting in a 404 error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created EventDetail Page (`src/pages/EventDetail.tsx`)
- **Full event details display** with hero image section
- **Responsive design** with main content and sidebar layout
- **Event information card** showing date, time, location, capacity
- **Registration/Calendar integration** 
- **Share functionality** with native sharing API fallback
- **Navigation controls** (back button, breadcrumbs)
- **Error handling** for non-existent events
- **Loading states** and proper error messages

### 2. Added Route to App.tsx
- **New route**: `/events/:id` → `<EventDetail />`
- **Lazy loading** for performance optimization
- **Proper import** added to the lazy loading section

### 3. Enhanced Features
- **Google Calendar integration** - "Add to Calendar" button creates calendar events
- **Social sharing** - Native share API with clipboard fallback
- **Registration handling** - Shows appropriate UI for events requiring registration
- **Contact integration** - Links to contact page for inquiries
- **Responsive design** - Works on all device sizes
- **SEO friendly** - Proper meta information and structure

### 4. Event Detail Page Features

#### Hero Section
- **Event image** as background (with fallback gradient)
- **Navigation controls** (back to events, share button)
- **Overlay design** for better text readability

#### Main Content
- **Event title and description**
- **Event type badges** (regular, special, recurring)
- **Detailed information card** with icons
- **Proper date/time formatting**
- **Location and capacity information**

#### Sidebar
- **Registration card** with appropriate actions
- **Contact information** for inquiries
- **Calendar integration** for easy event saving

#### Error Handling
- **Loading states** with spinner
- **404 handling** for non-existent events
- **Automatic redirect** to events page on error
- **User-friendly error messages**

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "View Event Details"** on any event card
2. **Navigates to `/events/{event-id}`**
3. **EventDetail page loads** and fetches event data from Supabase
4. **Displays full event information** with interactive features
5. **Provides actions** like calendar integration and sharing

## Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Supabase integration** for data fetching
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Error boundaries** and loading states
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

## Benefits

✅ **No more 404 errors** when clicking event details
✅ **Rich event information** display
✅ **Better user experience** with interactive features
✅ **Mobile-friendly** responsive design
✅ **SEO optimized** for better search visibility
✅ **Accessible** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
