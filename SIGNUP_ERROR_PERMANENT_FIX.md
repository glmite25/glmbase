# Permanent Fix for Signup Database Errors

## Problem Summary

Users are experiencing "Database error saving new user" with error code `unexpected_failure` when trying to sign up. This is caused by:

1. Missing or misconfigured database functions
2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking user creation
3. Database triggers failing during user registration
4. Missing database permissions

## The Complete Solution

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix Script

1. **Open your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Navigate to the SQL Editor**
3. **Copy the entire contents of `supabase/permanent_signup_fix.sql`**
4. **Paste and run the script**

The script will:
- ✅ Drop any problematic existing functions and triggers
- ✅ Ensure all required tables exist with correct structure
- ✅ Create a robust `create_user_profile_safe` function
- ✅ Set up automatic triggers for user profile creation
- ✅ Configure proper RLS policies that allow signup
- ✅ Grant all necessary permissions
- ✅ Add performance indexes
- ✅ Test the function to ensure it works

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After running the SQL script:

1. **Test signup process**:
   - Go to your application's signup page
   - Try creating a new account
   - The signup should now work without errors

2. **Check the database**:
   - New users should appear in both `profiles` and `members` tables
   - User data should be properly synchronized

3. **Test signin**:
   - Newly created accounts should be able to sign in successfully

## What This Fix Does

### Database Structure
- Ensures `profiles` and `members` tables exist with all required columns
- Adds missing columns if they don't exist
- Creates proper indexes for performance
- Sets up foreign key relationships

### Automatic Profile Creation
- Creates a trigger that automatically creates user profiles when accounts are created
- Handles both profile and member record creation in one transaction
- Includes comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Normalizes email addresses and handles edge cases

### Security Policies
- Configures RLS policies that allow signup while maintaining security
- Grants necessary permissions to all user roles (anon, authenticated, service_role)
- Uses SECURITY DEFINER functions for safe database operations

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling that logs issues but doesn't fail signup
- Fallback mechanisms if primary profile creation fails
- Detailed logging for debugging purposes

## Code Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Database Function (`create_user_profile_safe`)
- Input validation for all parameters
- Proper email normalization
- Automatic role assignment based on email
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- Upsert operations to handle existing users

### 2. Improved Trigger Function (`handle_new_user`)
- Extracts user data from multiple metadata sources
- Creates both profile and member records atomically
- Includes fallback for minimal profile creation
- Logs all operations for debugging

### 3. Updated Frontend Code
- Better error handling in `createUserProfile.ts`
- Improved user feedback in authentication hook
- More detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful handling of database function failures

## Testing Checklist

After applying the fix, verify these scenarios work:

- [ ] New user signup with all fields filled
- [ ] New user signup with minimal required fields  
- [ ] Signup with existing email (should show appropriate error)
- [ ] Signin with newly created account
- [ ] Profile data appears correctly in admin panel
- [ ] Member records are created automatically
- [ ] Admin users get proper roles assigned

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Supabase Logs
Monitor your Supabase logs for:
- Authentication errors
- Database function errors
- RLS policy violations

### Regular Testing
- Test signup process after any database changes
- Verify new user data appears in both tables
- Check that user roles are assigned correctly

### Performance Monitoring
The fix includes indexes on:
- `profiles.email`
- `profiles.id`
- `members.email`
- `members.userid`
- `members.category`

## Troubleshooting

### If Signup Still Fails

1. **Check Supabase logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify the SQL script ran completely** without errors
3. **Test the function manually**:
   ```sql
   SELECT public.create_user_profile_safe(
     '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012'::uuid,
     'test@example.com',
     'Test User',
     'Test Unit',
     '+1234567890'
   );
   ```

### If Profile Creation Fails

The system has multiple fallback mechanisms:
1. Primary: `create_user_profile_safe` function
2. Secondary: Direct table inserts with retry logic
3. Tertiary: Automatic trigger on user creation
4. Fallback: Minimal profile creation

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Function does not exist"
**Solution**: Re-run the SQL script to create the function

**Issue**: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Check that all GRANT statements were executed

**Issue**: "Column does not exist"
**Solution**: The script adds missing columns automatically

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Regular Backups**: Backup your database before making changes
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for authentication failures
3. **Testing**: Include signup/signin in your regular testing routine
4. **Updates**: Keep Supabase client libraries updated

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Verify your environment variables are correct
4. Ensure your Supabase project is active and not paused
