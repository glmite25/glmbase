# Admin Dashboard Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the admin dashboard issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **"Continuing with limited functionality" message**
   - Increased authentication timeouts to prevent premature timeout messages

2. **Admin user list not showing current admin users**
   - Improved the user management service to better handle roles and provide more detailed logging

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Authentication Timeouts in `AuthContext.tsx`

- Increased auth initialization timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Increased session fetch timeout from 5 seconds to 15 seconds
- Increased profile fetch timeout from 8 seconds to 15 seconds
- Increased profile data fetch timeout from 5 seconds to 10 seconds
- Increased user data fetch timeout from 3 seconds to 8 seconds
- Increased role data fetch timeout from 3 seconds to 8 seconds

These changes give the authentication process more time to complete, reducing the likelihood of seeing the "Continuing with limited functionality" message.

### 2. Improved User Management Service in `UserManagementService.ts`

- Added better logging to help diagnose issues
- Improved error handling to show more detailed error messages
- Enhanced the role determination logic to handle multiple roles per user
- Added debugging information to help identify where things are going wrong

The key improvement is in how roles are determined:
```javascript
// Find all roles for this user
const userRoles = rolesData.filter((role) => role.user_id === profile.id);

// Determine the highest role (superuser > admin > user)
let highestRole = "user";
if (userRoles.some(r => r.role === "superuser")) {
  highestRole = "superuser";
} else if (userRoles.some(r => r.role === "admin")) {
  highestRole = "admin";
}
```

### 3. Added New Utility Functions to `UserManagementService.ts`

- `addUserRole`: A function to add a role to a user
- `removeUserRole`: A function to remove a role from a user

These functions can be used to manage user roles programmatically.

## Verification

To verify that the fixes are working:

1. Refresh the application and check if the "Continuing with limited functionality" message still appears
2. Go to the User Management section and verify that admin users are displayed correctly
3. Check the browser console for any error messages or warnings

## Additional Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Clear browser cache and local storage
2. Check network requests in the browser developer tools
3. Verify that the Supabase functions for super admin management are working correctly
4. Check for any CORS issues in the network requests

## SQL Functions

Make sure you've applied the SQL fixes for the super admin functions:

1. `add_super_admin_by_email`: Fixed ambiguous column reference
2. `list_super_admins`: Changed return type to JSONB
3. `remove_super_admin`: Added table aliases for consistency

These SQL functions should be updated using the script in `src/integrations/supabase/fix_superadmin_function_with_drops.sql`.
