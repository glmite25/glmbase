## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes Made
```sql
-- Created app_role enum type
CREATE TYPE app_role AS ENUM ('user', 'admin', 'superuser');

-- Added role column to members table
ALTER TABLE members 
ADD COLUMN role app_role DEFAULT 'user';

-- Updated superuser accounts
UPDATE members 
SET role = 'superuser' 
WHERE email IN ('ojidelawrence@gmail.com', 'popsabey1@gmail.com');
```

### Test Files Created/Updated
- ✅ `task-7-2-auth-test.js` - Main authentication flow tests
- ✅ `task-7-2-validation.js` - Validation script for requirements
- ✅ `comprehensive-auth-test.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ `run-authentication-tests.js` - Test runner with environment support

### Key Findings
1. **Consolidated Structure Works**: The enhanced members table successfully serves as the primary source of truth for user data
2. **Authentication Flows Intact**: All login/logout functionality works correctly with the consolidated structure
3. **Access Controls Functional**: Admin and superuser access controls are properly implemented and validated
4. **Profile-Member Sync**: The system correctly handles user registration and maintains proper links between auth.users and members
