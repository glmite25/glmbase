### 2. Login as Admin

## üîß How It Works

### Authentication Flow

2. System checks for admin roles in database
3. Fallback to email whitelist for emergency access
4. Admin status stored in localStorage for performance

### Admin Email Whitelist
These emails automatically get admin access:
- `ojidelawrence@gmail.com` (Super Admin)
- `admin@gospellabourministry.com` (Admin)
- `superadmin@gospellabourministry.com` (Super Admin)

### Database Tables

## üîÑ User-Member Synchronization

### How It Works
1. **New Registration**: When a user registers, a member record is automatically created

3. **Data Consistency**: Database triggers ensure data stays in sync
4. **Mock Data Removal**: Setup script removes any test data not linked to real users

### Sync Features
- **Automatic Creation**: All auth users get member records
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile changes immediately sync
- **Category Assignment**: Admin emails automatically get "Pastors" category
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive status based on auth status

2. Click "Sync with Auth" button
3. System will reconcile any differences
