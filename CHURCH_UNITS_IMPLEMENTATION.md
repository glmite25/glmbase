# Church Units Implementation - Sanitation & Ushering

## Overview
Successfully added two new church units "Sanitation" and "Ushering" to the Gospel Labour Ministry system with complete functionality and proper icons.

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. Church Units Constants (`src/constants/churchUnits.ts`)
- âœ… Added "Ushering" unit with ID `ushering` and description "Welcoming and Directing Worshippers"
- âœ… Added "Sanitation" unit with ID `sanitation` and description "Church Sanitation and Hygiene"
- âœ… Both units are now part of `OFFICIAL_CHURCH_UNITS` array
- âœ… All derived constants automatically include the new units

### 2. Icon System (`src/constants/unitIcons.ts`)
- âœ… Created comprehensive icon mapping system
- âœ… Assigned appropriate Lucide React icons:
  - **Ushering**: `UserCheck` icon (welcoming/directing people)
  - **Sanitation**: `Trash2` icon (cleaning/hygiene)
- âœ… Added color schemes:
  - **Ushering**: Indigo theme (`bg-indigo-100`, `text-indigo-600`)
  - **Sanitation**: Teal theme (`bg-teal-100`, `text-teal-600`)
- âœ… Fallback system for unknown units

### 3. Admin Dashboard Components

#### UnitsOverview (`src/components/admin/units/UnitsOverview.tsx`)
- âœ… Updated to use new icon system
- âœ… Dynamic icon and color rendering for all units
- âœ… Proper navigation to unit-specific pages

#### AdminSidebar (`src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`)
- âœ… Added icons for new units in navigation
- âœ… Updated `getIconForChurchUnit` function
- âœ… Imported required Lucide icons (`Trash2`, `Zap`)

### 4. Routing System (`src/App.tsx`)
- âœ… Added routes for new units:
  - `/admin/units/ushering`
  - `/admin/units/sanitation`
- âœ… Both routes properly handled by AdminDashboard component

### 5. Existing Components (Auto-Updated)
These components automatically support the new units because they use the constants:

- âœ… **MultipleChurchUnitsSelect**: Uses `OFFICIAL_CHURCH_UNITS`
- âœ… **MembersManager**: Uses `CHURCH_UNIT_NAMES`
- âœ… **AddMemberToUnitDialog**: Works with any valid unit ID
- âœ… **UnitMembersView**: Dynamically handles any unit
- âœ… **UnitMembersTable**: Queries work with new unit IDs

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Available for New Units

### For Ushering Unit:
- âœ… Dedicated admin page at `/admin/units/ushering`
- âœ… Member management (add, view, search)
- âœ… Statistics dashboard (total, active, inactive members)
- âœ… Icon: UserCheck (indigo theme)
- âœ… Navigation in admin sidebar
- âœ… Member assignment via email or dropdown

### For Sanitation Unit:
- âœ… Dedicated admin page at `/admin/units/sanitation`

- âœ… Navigation in admin sidebar
- âœ… Member assignment via email or dropdown

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Compatibility

- âœ… Backward compatible with existing data

### Icon System Architecture
```typescript
// Icon mapping with fallback
export const UNIT_ICONS: Record<string, LucideIcon> = {
  "ushering": UserCheck,
  "sanitation": Trash2,
  // ... other units
};

// Color theming
export const getUnitIconColors = (unitId: string) => {
  // Returns appropriate bg and text color classes
};
```

### Component Integration
- All existing forms and selects automatically include new units
- No manual updates needed for dropdowns or multi-selects
- Consistent styling and behavior across all components

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

### Test Component Created
- âœ… `UnitsTestPage.tsx` - Displays all units with icons and colors
- âœ… Verifies proper configuration
- âœ… Shows unit details and status

### Manual Testing Checklist
